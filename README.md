# Project Name

To-Do Manager

## Description

This is a to-do list that manages the tasks you want to complete. It takes in inputs from the webpage and sends it over to the database to be added. This update is reflected right back to the webpage, where you can see your new task.

## Use
- Add your own database
- Run the server
- Type in your inputs
- Mark them as complete as you do them
- Delete them if you made a mistake or if you just don't want it there
